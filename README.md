# wordpress-to-webhook
A plugin made for WPForms where you can trigger the form data to a webhook. I use it personally for a Discord Webhook.


# How does it works?
The plugin has various parameters that can be changed:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>webhook_url</b>: This is the parameter where you should put the webhook url to make it work.</li><br>
  <li><b>message</b>: The message that it's going to be sent to the webhook. This can be fully customized. If you want to add more things, just concatenate various strings to have the desired result.</li>
</ul>
<br>
With this parameters set, everything should work fine.
